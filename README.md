# Welcome to the Jamba Juice BarÂ®

This demo is about building a **Streaming Data Warehouse** for a fictitious company, Jamba Juice, based on [Spark Structured Streaming](https://github.com/apache/spark) and [Delta](https://github.com/delta-io/delta).

**Motivation:** You run a smoothie shop, but really want to keep track of your sales - in real-time!
